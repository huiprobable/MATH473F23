    "    * [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html): high-level interface to Matplotlib, statistical functions built in\n",
    "    * [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html): declarative visualization (R users will be more at home), statistics built in\n",
    "    * [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): interactive graphs\n",
    "    * [Bokeh](https://demo.bokeh.org/): also here good for interactivity\n",
    "    * [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/): implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)\n",
    "    * [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/): R users will be more at home\n",
    "    * [PyNGL](https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Examples/gallery.shtml): used in the weather forecast community\n",
    "    * [K3D](https://k3d-jupyter.org/showcase/): Jupyter notebook extension for 3D visualization\n",

    "* First try to reproduce this example in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "* Then try to print out the data that is used in this example just before the call of the plotting function to learn about its structure. Is it a pandas dataframe? Is it a NumPy array? Is it a dictionary? A list? a list of lists?\n",
    "* Then try to modify the data a bit.\n",
    "* If you have time, try to feed it different, simplified data. This will be key for adapting the examples to your projects.\n",
