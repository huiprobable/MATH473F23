    "Students are required to attend every class. However, attendance and participation will not be used in grade determination. It is the student’s responsibility to keep informed of any announcements, syllabus adjustments, or policy changes made during scheduled classes. If you miss the deadline of one due material, you may make it up or turn it in late, but you need to provide legitimate reasons. Otherwise, the instructor may not accept the late material or may deduct partial credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cheating and Plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although students are encouraged to work together on the lab assignments, the work you turn in must be products of your own intellectual activity. The quizzes are all open book, open notes, but you may not ask someone to do the work for you, and you are not allowed to discuss with each other solutions to quiz problems. Cheating and plagiarism are serious academic offenses. Please read the section on cheating and plagiarism in the CSULB Catalog.
