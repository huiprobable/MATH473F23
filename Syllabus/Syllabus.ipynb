    "1. If you have disability and need some special accommodation, you need to visit Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC) [https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/](https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/). It is your responsibility to notify me, in advance, of your need for the accommodation of a disability that has been verified by the University.\n",
    "2. If you do not have a laptop or only have poor internet access, you may check out CSULB’s announcement regarding supplying you with laptops and internet hotspots. Please see the webpage linked here: [https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students? fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo](https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students?fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo).\n",
    "3. If you need help on Canvas, Zoom, or other technical area related to online learning, you may seek help from Academic Technology Services. Here is their website: [https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services](https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services). You may find the Keep Learning module in this website helpful.

    "### Dropping or Withdrawal:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to drop (within first two weeks), withdraw (week 3-12), or catastrophic withdraw (week 13-15) from the class, you may follow the guideline in this website [https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing](https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance and Missed Assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are required to attend every class. However, attendance and participation will not be used in grade determination. It is the student’s responsibility to keep informed of any announcements, syllabus adjustments, or policy changes made during scheduled classes. If you miss the deadline of one due material, you may make it up or turn it in late, but you need to provide legitimate reasons. Otherwise, the instructor may not accept the late material or may deduct partial credits.\n",

    "### Cheating and Plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Work that you submit is assumed to be original for this assignment unless your source material is documented appropriately, such as a Works Cited page. Using the ideas or words of another person, even a peer, or a web site, as if it were your own, is plagiarism. Cheating and plagiarism are serious academic offenses, and are not allowed in this course. \n",
